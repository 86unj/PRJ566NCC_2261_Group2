## 🎯 Overview

The **Seneca Campus Lost & Found System** is a centralized digital platform designed to help students at Seneca Polytechnic report, browse, and match lost and found items efficiently. This project addresses the current lack of a user-friendly system for managing lost items across campus.

### Background

Seneca is a large campus with multiple buildings and shared spaces, increasing the likelihood of lost items. Currently, students rely on:
- Manual processes through campus security
- Unofficial group chats and social media

These approaches are fragmented, time-consuming, and often ineffective.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

There is **no centralized, accessible system** for reporting and searching lost and found items at Seneca Polytechnic.

### Who is Affected?

- **Students**: Lose valuable or essential items such as student IDs, headphones, and water bottles
- **Campus Security**: Faces increased manual workload managing lost items
- **Campus Community**: Experiences frustration and inefficiency in item recovery

### Supporting Evidence

- High student population increases lost-item frequency
- Manual processes lead to delays and unclaimed items
- Digital platforms are proven to improve information accessibility
